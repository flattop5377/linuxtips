# Ansible

The easiest way to use the Linux Life Hacks here is through
[Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html)
.  However, Ansible is very powerful, so you may not want to for a variety of
reasons.  The hacks can also be done manually.

At a minimum, please check the sha512 checksum, and consider checking the
signature whenever available.
